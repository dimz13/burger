## How it works
  - Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
  - Each burger in the waiting area also has a EAT IT! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
  - The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
